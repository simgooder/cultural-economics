    desc: "From harvest to preparing to processing. This short film by Martin Borden follows artist Sharon Kallis over a two year period on her journey to make a coat and sweater-vest with Stinging Nettles and other fibre plants she has grown and tended.
    Working out of city parks in Vancouver, British Columbia, Sharon's work explores what it takes to clothe oneself from the fibres at hand.
    Learning new skills, working within a seasonal rhythm, help from other skill-holders and exploring the connecting threads of her  own Celtic Ancestors to the Ancestors of the Coast Salish peoples' whose unceded land she lives and works on are some of the ideas explored."
