    name: How To Make Smoking Pipes From Wood

    desc: In this video, I want to show you how to make a pipe from a few tree branches I found. I used a walnut tree branch for the pipe mouthpiece. I was able to create a beautiful shape without any difficulty, thanks to the fact that the branch bends easily when it is fresh and is hollow inside. For the pipe head, I used walnut tree, pear tree, pine tree and fir tree branches. What mattered most to me was the view of the tree branch. In this way, different tastes as well as different appearances emerged.
